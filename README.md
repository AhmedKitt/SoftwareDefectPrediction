# SoftwareDefectPrediction
This repository hosts the Hybrid Feature-Driven Convolutional Bi-LSTM Model (HFDCL), a novel software defect prediction approach. The HFDCL combines traditional and semantic features, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) for improved prediction accuracy
